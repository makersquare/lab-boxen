# Lab Boxen

To set up a new lab machine, check out the pre (and post) setup instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/techpeace/c93f9fb4b7483f5f8c41).

After running through the pre-boxen setup instructions, head on over to [the Boxen web interface](http://makersquare-lab-boxen.heroku.com) and run the command listed there under a terminal on the student account.

After boxen finishes doing its sweet, sweet thing, run through the post-boxen setup instructions (that I was too lazy to automate). Blammo! You've got yourself a new lab machine.
